Welcome to Pixel Pulse, a visually stunning video game news network site crafted with a focus on exceptional user experience. By harnessing the capabilities of React JS to build a dynamic and responsive interface, and Tailwind CSS to create a bespoke design language, this project showcases the perfect blend of form and function. With Git version control ensuring seamless collaboration and BlackBoxAI's AI-driven insights informing our design decisions, we're redefining the front-end of video game news and discovery.
The Page performance was optimized by leveraging the technology of LazyLoadImage.

The Technologies used in the Project are: 

        React JS
        Tailwind CSS
        Github

In crafting the visual identity of our video game news network site, we leveraged the extensive libraries of icons from Icons8 and Bootstrap, carefully selecting and integrating these design elements to create a cohesive and engaging user experience. Links to their Website is given below:

        Icons 8: https://icons8.com/
        Bootstrap Icons: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/
